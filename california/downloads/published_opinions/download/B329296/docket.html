Alan S. Yockelson, counsel for appellant James Heaps.<br><br>On June 20, 2023, appellant filed his petition for bail pending appeal.

The People have not, as of this morning, filed opposition as requested by the Court. Therefore, appellant asks this Court to consider his petition for bail pending appeal unopposed and to grant the relief requested in his petition as soon as possible on whatever terms the Court deems just and proper.

Alan Yockelson, counsel for appellant.Appellant has been both diligent and patient while waiting for the record on appeal to be filed. While waiting for the record in order to file his renewed motion, Appellant lost the potential opportunity to spend the holidays with his family, and now faces retrial on nine counts the jury hung on during trial. Appellant's counsel cannot, in good conscience, once again agree to further delay in this Court determining the motion on its merits. Therefore, appellant asks this Court to consider his renewed petition for bail pending appeal unopposed and to grant the relief requested in his petition as soon as possible on whatever terms the Court deems just and proper.

A. Yockelson. Ms. Lozano, could you please explain why up until early this morning the Court's website, under scheduled actions, included a 2/20/2024 due date for the People's opposition, but now that entry has been removed? DAG Lieberman claims neither he, nor anyone from his office, saw that entry or due date. I would not like the Court to be under the misconception, as stated in Mr. Liberman's letter to the Court, that I was either mistaken or otherwise incorrect in noting in my letter that the Court's website did indeed list a due date for opposition that was not met by the People.

counsel. The scheduled actions are placed with a due date. In Division One, we run an overdue scheduled actions report every morning. If an action is overdue and the party did not act on it, we delete it and advise chambers that the filing was never performed. <br><br>If the filing is in fact submitted, the scheduled action is also deleted.<br><br>DAG Liberman did not file the opposition by the due date and that is why I deleted the entry today, as we are no longer waiting or tracking for an opposition to be filed.

Gary Lieberman, counsel for The People.<br><br>In his letter of February 21, 2024, appellant asks this Court to "consider his renewed<br>petition for bail pending appeal unopposed." Appellant states that " [t]he People's due date for any opposition was calculated and listed on this Court's website as February 20, 2024." Appellant is mistaken: the Court has not issued an order requiring a response or setting forth a date for an opposition, and nothing indicating this appears anywhere on this Court's website. Indeed, as appellant correctly notes, respondent was not required to file an opposition to appellant's initial bail motion until this Court issued an order that opposition was required to be fi led on July 14, 2023. Again, no such similar order has been issued as to appellant's renewed<br>bail motion.

Alan S. Yockelson, counsel for appellant.<br><br>On May 3, 2024, the Court granted Appellant's Motion for access to certain sealed records. Included in that Order was access to Item #1 -- Declaration of "Marc Smith in Support of Defendant's Motion in Limine to Admit Evidence of Fact that all Alleged Patient Victims had Filed Lawsuits or a Claim and Resolved it Through Settlement; and Supporting Exhibits." Upon receipt from the Court of the sealed material, examination of Item #1 revealed that the document is missing Exhibits G, H, and I, that are referenced in the declaration but were not contained within the documents sent to Appellant's Counsel. It is, at this time, not clear whether those Exhibits were omitted in error by this Court, or the Superior Court in its certification of the record on appeal. Appellant will do whatever he can, as directed by this Court to obtain those missing Exhibits.

This Court is in receipt of appellant's September 16, 2025 letter brief transmitting a copy of the superior court's September 3, 2025 ruling on appellant's August 1, 2025 motion for release on bail pending appeal. To the extent the letter brief purports to seek review of the superior court's September 3, 2025 order, any such relief must be sought via the filing of a motion in this Court. We note appellant's letter brief suggests that this Court's August 23, 2023 order denying his first motion for bail on appeal without prejudice should be interpreted to have limited the scope of the superior court's consideration of appellant's current motion for bail on appeal. This Court denied appellant's renewed motion for bail on appeal on April 3, 2024. On July 3, 2025, this Court denied appellant's third motion for bail on appeal without prejudice to appellant's filing a new motion in the superior court. Neither this Court's April 3, 2024 order nor the July 3, 2025 order contained any limiting language directing the contents or scope of any subsequent motions or filings or any limit on the superior court's decisions in any further proceedings, and no such limitation is or was intended by any of this Court's orders.
